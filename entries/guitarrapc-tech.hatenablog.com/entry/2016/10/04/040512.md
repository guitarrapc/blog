There are no chance of me to write Anagram check in C#.

> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram

Let's see some article posted.

It says he met anagram question with **code interview** and answer was as follows.

```ruby
def anagram(s1, s2)
  s1.chars.sort == s2.chars.sort
end
```

Let's try in C#.

# Enumerable.Except

First, I thought it's not good to use Sort for performance issue, and imagine to use `Enumerable.Except`.

But soon I forgive it. Except will be worth when duplicate character is accepted but may take too much check if no allowed. You can see #7 failed with "aba == bab" was true!

Same issue will happen with `Enumerable.All`.

# O(n log n) : Sort with Enumerable.SequenceEqual

May be one of the easiest way is sort array then check. Let's use `Enumerable.SequenceEqual()` to sorted array.

It passes all tests. But is `O(n log n)`....

string null conditional check `?.` will cause duplicate null check, so it may take bit more time.

## No LINQ

I like LINQ but let's try no LINQ. Looks like better performance, 181ms.

# O(n) : Dictionary

Let's remove `sort` and just count with Dictionary. This bring much better performance, only 124ms.

Also here's my friend [@ichiohta](https://twitter.com/ichiohta)'s code.

It takes much time in `.GroupBy().ToDictionary()`. Swap with my code brings 267ms -> 127ms.

Dictionary is much better performance than Sort algorithm.

# Conclusion

Pattern | Algorithm | time in 12 test x 100000
---- | ---- | ----
Sort (LINQ : Enumerable.SequenceEqual) | `O(n log n)` | 280ms
Sort (LINQ : Enumerable.SequenceEqual + ?.) | `O(n log n)` | 290ms - 580ms
Sort (NO LINQ) | `O(n log n)` | 181ms
Dictionary (NO LINQ) | `O(n)` | 124ms
Dictionary (LINQ : GroupBy().ToDictionary()) | `O(n)` | 267ms

What's the most readable and fast enough code for you? More idea is much appreciated.
