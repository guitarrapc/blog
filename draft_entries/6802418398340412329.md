<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo148ARBK0o&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Michael Washam - Introduction to Windows Azure PowerShell</a>
Let have a look this session.
## Beginning
The session was made by Michael Washam. Aim of this sessions is "Getting started Windows Azure with PowerShell", means "control Subscription with PowerShell". The key-word is Devops.
"Optimization = Pay as You Go = Automation = Coding"
Why with use PowerShell? Because it is the way to achieve Automation.
What can you do with PowerShell 1. Automation 2. Provision Fully Configured Virtual Machine 3. Virtual Networking
## 1. Get Azure PowerShell
You can get PowerShell Cmdlets for Windows Azure from below URI. Make sure your have an Subscription Account binding with Azure Subscription.... Me? no I wans't retrieve yet :(
Azure PowerShell Download. (Automatically configures Subscription ID, Certificate) http://windows.azure.com/download/publishprofile.aspx
## Set your StorageSubscription
Let's begin switching subscription settings.
Switching Between Subscription Settings. (Multiple Subscription Support)
This is to retrieve multiple Subscriptions of your zure account

```ps1
Get-AzureSubscription | %{
 Select-AzureSubscription $_.SubscriptionName
 #Perform Management Operation Against Each Subscription
}
```

Wow, let's try.
Available to setup the current storage account from PowerShell
1. Returns Storage Account

```ps1
Get-AzureStorageAccount | Select StorageAccountName
```

2. Sets the Current Storage Account... hmmmmm... no result... you not obtain any AzureStorageAccount yet?

```ps1
Set-AzureSubscription 'somesub1' -CurrentStorageAccount 'mystorage'
```

3. cmdlets like New-AzureQuickVM will use this Account (This time not work, because you need to get storage account info first.)
## Retrieve your AzurePublishSettingsFile
1. Let's try this command set.

```ps1
Import-Module Azure
Get-AzureSubscription
Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile
```

2. Now you will navagate into Azure Platform. Login to Subscription and download AzurePublishSettingsFile into your local.
## Import your AzurePublishSettingsFile
1. Sample here

```ps1
Import-AzurePuclishSettingsFile -PublishSettingsFie D:\hoge\TechEd-SP-mm-dd-yyyy-credential-publishsettings
```

2. Now your default and curret subscription is imported file "TechEd-SP-mm-dd-yyyy-credential-publishsettings" which has been downloaded by Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile. 3. You can see your StorageAccount by:

```ps1
Get-AzureStorageAccount | select StorageAccountName
```

Also,

```ps1
Get-AzureSubscription | select SubscriptionName
```

## Set your AzureSubscription
1. Now you can do it.

```ps1
Set-AzureSubscription -Subscriptionname "TechED-SP" -CurrentStorageAccount mydemoStoragea1
```

2. then retrieve change

```ps1
Get-AzureVM
```

## Restart your VM through PowerShell
1. Restart your VM, please specify which to restart. Your can check names by `Get-AzureVM`.

```ps1
Restart-AzureVM -ServiceName myvm1demosvc -name myvm1
```

2. You will be noticed status of restart progress by notification bar on PowerShell.exe sample like
Get Development "Operation Status : Succeed" Restart-AzureVM "Operation Status: Inprogress"
## Conclution
Getting started is over. Let's have a fun with next session.
